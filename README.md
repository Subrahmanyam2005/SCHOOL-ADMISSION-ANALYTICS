# SCHOOL-ADMISSION-ANALYTICS

Here's a detailed project description for Student Admission Data Analytics project using Python:

---
📝 Project Title:

Student Admission Data Analytics Using Python


---

📌 Project Description:

This project aims to perform a comprehensive data analysis on a dataset containing information about students' academic performance and extracurricular involvement to understand patterns in college admission decisions. Using Python and its powerful data analysis libraries, the project explores how factors such as GPA, SAT scores, and Extracurricular Activities influence Admission Status.


---

🎯 Objectives:

To explore and clean the student admission dataset.

To visualize data distributions and relationships between features.

To identify key factors influencing admission decisions.

To derive insights that may guide applicants and admission committees.



---

📊 Dataset Overview:

The dataset consists of 250 student records with the following features:

Feature	Description

GPA	Grade Point Average (scale of 0 to 4.0)
SAT_Score	Standardized SAT score (400 to 1600)
Extracurricular_Activities	Count of activities participated in
Admission_Status	Admission result: Accepted or Rejected



---

🛠 Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas (data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)



---

📈 Data Visualization Techniques Used:

Histograms – to show distributions of GPA and SAT scores.

Boxplots – to compare score variations by admission status.

Heatmaps – to visualize feature correlation.

Pie Charts – to show category proportions (Admission Status, Activity Levels).

Violin/Strip/Swarm/Joint Plots – for detailed visual analytics.

Countplots and KDE Plots – for frequency and density analysis.



---

💡 Insights Gained:

Students with higher GPAs and SAT scores have significantly better chances of being admitted.

Extracurricular involvement also plays a role but is less predictive alone.

Accepted students tend to cluster at higher GPA/SAT values.

There is a strong correlation between GPA and SAT Score for admitted students.



---

📌 Future Enhancements:

Add predictive modeling using logistic regression or decision trees.

Include interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.

Expand dataset to include demographics or essay scores for deeper insight.
